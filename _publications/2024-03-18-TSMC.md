excerpt: '1) A more adaptable 3-D dense mapping robotic system based on self-designed scanning BSL, named ROVScanner, is developed for refined exploration, where the on-board design allows for autonomous mobility and operational capabilities. A more efficient underwater 3-D dense mapping algorithm fusing DVL, inertial measurement unit (IMU) and pressure sensor multifrequency information is proposed to realize dense mapping during robot motion.

2) An air–water two-stage underwater multisensor calibration method is presented. In particular, the extrinsic parameters between DVL and camera are innovatively calibrated using BSL based on graph optimization, enhancing robustness.

3) A framework of BSL-based collision-free navigation is presented to guarantee the safe movement of the system in unknown dark environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that can simultaneously realize autonomous collision-free navigation and dense mapping in dark underwater environments by utilizing active structured light vision.'

Underwater collision-free navigation and dense reconstruction are essential for marine refined exploration. However, existing passive vision-based methods are difficult to apply in low-light and weak-feature underwater environments. In this article, a more adaptable three-dimensional (3-D) dense mapping robotic system based on self-designed scanning binocular structured light (BSL), named ROV-Scanner, is developed to address this challenge. First, the measurement principle based on the refraction model ensures its high accuracy. Second, an underwater 3-D dense mapping algorithm fusing the Doppler velocity log (DVL), inertial measurement unit (IMU), and pressure sensor multifrequency information is proposed to realize dense mapping during robot motion. Then, an air–water two-stage extrinsic calibration algorithm is proposed. In particular, the extrinsic parameters between DVL and camera are innovatively calibrated using BSL, enhancing robustness. Furthermore, for the first time, a framework of BSL-based collision-free navigation is presented to guarantee the safe movement of the system in unknown environments. Experimental results show that our system can simultaneously achieve autonomous collision-free navigation and dense mapping in dark underwater environments, which has great potential for application in marine refined exploration.
