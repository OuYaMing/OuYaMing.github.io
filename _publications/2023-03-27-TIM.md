excerpt: '1) An underwater binocular structured light 3-D reconstruction system with the scanning laser is designed to realize the static high-precision scanning reconstruction of the low-light scene, which is suitable for underwater robot application, including grasping, surveying, and mapping. The obtained high-precision 3-D point clouds prove the effectiveness of our system.

2) Three models based on underwater refraction effects are systematically proposed, among which the multimedia binocular polar curve constraint model ensures accurate laser line matching, which is a relatively cutting-edge work.

3) A simple special calibration block is designed, and a new multiobjective laser-based calibration algorithm based on laser geometric constraints is proposed. The proposed method only needs one scanning data, which greatly simplifies the calibration process. More importantly, this method could achieve accurate calibration in the low-light underwater environment, which is hard for the checkerboard-based calibration method.'

The 3-D perception of the low-light underwater environment has always been a major challenge, which greatly limits underwater operations. In this article, an underwater active vision measurement system based on binocular structured light is designed to achieve high-precision 3-D reconstruction. First, the fusion technology of binocular camera and laser addresses underwater optical attenuation and feature sparsity. Then, in order to avoid the huge inertia caused by the overall movement of the system, a laser scanner based on the mirror galvanometer is used to accomplish static scanning of the scene. Subsequently, considering the influence of multiple media, underwater refraction models, including the monocular imaging model, the binocular ranging model, and the binocular polar curve constraint model, are systematically proposed. What is more, the conventional checkerboard-based passive visual calibration method is ineffective for low-light waters. Therefore, a simple calibration block is designed, and a new multiobjective laser-based calibration algorithm based on laser geometric constraints is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the system is verified by analyzing the 3-D reconstruction results of underwater objects.
