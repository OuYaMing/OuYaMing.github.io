excerpt: '1) A more adaptable 3-D dense mapping robotic system based on self-designed scanning BSL, named ROVScanner, is developed for refined exploration, where the on-board design allows for autonomous mobility and operational capabilities. A more efficient underwater 3-D dense mapping algorithm fusing DVL, inertial measurement unit (IMU) and pressure sensor multifrequency information is proposed to realize dense mapping during robot motion.

2) An airâ€“water two-stage underwater multisensor calibration method is presented. In particular, the extrinsic parameters between DVL and camera are innovatively calibrated using BSL based on graph optimization, enhancing robustness.

3) A framework of BSL-based collision-free navigation is presented to guarantee the safe movement of the system in unknown dark environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that can simultaneously realize autonomous collision-free navigation and dense mapping in dark underwater environments by utilizing active structured light vision.'

Structured light systems are widely used in underwater dense reconstruction due to their excellent accuracy. However, the current related methods mainly focus on fixed positions. The reconstruction performance in motion is insufficient. Therefore, we propose an underwater movable binocular structured light (MBSL) based high-precision dense reconstruction framework, named WaterMBSL, to realize the robot reconstruction while moving. Specifically, an onboard binocular structured light system based on mirror-galvanometer is developed first. Then, a simplified underwater point cloud acquisition algorithm is presented to quickly obtain 3-D information of the scene. Besides, a new underwater motion compensation algorithm combining inertial measurement unit and uniform velocity model is proposed. Moreover, the generalized-ICP point cloud registration algorithm is introduced to achieve accurate motion estimation. Finally, an underwater movable reconstruction platform is developed by integrating the self-designed structured light system with the underwater robot BlueROV for validating the performance of our proposed Water-MBSL. Experimental results show that satisfactory motion reconstruction performance can be obtained.
