excerpt: '1) A novel underwater pipeline positioning method based on dual-line laser SLV is proposed, which can simultaneously obtain the lateral deviation, height deviation and heading deviation of underwater vehicle and underwater pipeline under weak light water environment, providing the basis for underwater pipeline tracking.

2) By combining laser stripe image feature points, refracted underwater SLV model and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) information, the tracking and dense 3D reconstruction of underwater pipeline are realized, which is difficult for existing underwater inspection methods.

3) By integrating the self-designed underwater SLV sensor with the underwater vehicle BlueROV, an underwater pipeline tracking and 3D reconstruction system is developed, and a series of planar and spatial pipeline experiments are carried out to verify its effectiveness.'

The inspection of underwater pipeline by underwater vehicles is of great significance to ensure safe transportation. However, most of underwater pipeline inspection methods have disadvantages such as low precision, low resolution and less information, and cannot realize the fine three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of underwater pipelines. In order to address these problems, an underwater pipeline tracking and 3D reconstruction method for underwater vehicle based on structured light vision (SLV) is proposed. Firstly, a dual-line laser SLV is developed, and a new underwater pipeline positioning method is proposed, which can simultaneously obtain the lateral deviation, height deviation and heading deviation of underwater vehicle and underwater pipeline under weak light water environment. Then, by combining laser stripe image feature points, refracted underwater SLV model and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) information, underwater pipeline tracking and dense 3D reconstruction are realized. Finally, by integrating the self-designed underwater SLV sensor with the underwater vehicle BlueROV, an underwater pipeline tracking and 3D reconstruction system is developed. A series of planar and spatial pipeline tracking and 3D reconstruction experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
