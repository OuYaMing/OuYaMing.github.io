excerpt: '1) An underwater tightly-coupled hybrid visual inertial dense SLAM framework, named Hybrid-VINS, is proposed, which is more suitable for underwater scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first underwater SLAM system to utilize active vision information to assist passive vision.

2) The self-designed structured light system is used to correct the depth measurement of some features during passive vision initialization and tracking, which improves the localization accuracy. In addition, the introduction of the structured light system information realizes the VINS dense mapping, which is very rare underwater.

3) A more robust hybrid vision-aided loop closure detection algorithm is proposed to overcome the inaccuracy of purely passive vision loop factor.

4) The underwater autonomous hybrid vision system is developed in an underwater simulation environment and the real underwater world, respectively, to collect multiple datasets to validate the performance of Hybrid-VINS.'

Traditional visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods primarily rely on passive vision, such as monocular cameras, which often exhibit reduced accuracy in localization and struggle to create dense maps in low-light underwater conditions. In this paper, a tightly-coupled hybrid visual inertial navigation system (VINS), named Hybrid-VINS, is proposed by fusing active and passive vision, which enables robust localization and dense mapping underwater. Specifically, a self-designed active vision device called underwater binocular structured light (UBSL) is integrated to provide more accurate depth estimation of the scene, enhancing the initialization and visual feature tracking process of monocular VINS. As well as it addresses the deficiency of VINS in dense mapping. In addition, a more robust hybrid vision-aided loop closure detection algorithm is proposed to mitigate issues stemming from pure passive vision misjudgments and mismatches. Furthermore, an underwater autonomous hybrid vision system is developed in both simulated and realworld underwater environments to collect various datasets for verifying the performance of Hybrid-VINS. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with passive VINS, Hybrid-VINS holds greater promise for underwater highprecision localization and dense mapping.
